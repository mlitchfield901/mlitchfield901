<h1> Welcome All!</h1>
<h2>By day, I am an electrical engineer designing power and lighting systems for retail and school construction projects, but by night I am a beginner programmer, collector and tech enthusist with a goal of becoming a software or web developer. When I am not playing prentend with my children or spending time with my wife, I can usually be found listening to a podcast, working on some hobby projects, or just relaxing playing a video game.

In my recent years of becoming a parent of two, I have learned two important lessons - it is important to have a work- life balance and to always being learning. I strive to apply these to my life everyday, whether making sure I allow time to make memories with my family or just taking some time to myself to unwind and maybe even learn some new skills with online classes.</h2>
